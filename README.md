# üåé Genetic TSP Optimizer

This project solves the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** enhanced with:

* **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NNH)** seeding
* **Adaptive mutation** for diversity
* **Elitism** for preserving top-performing solutions

The algorithm dynamically adjusts configurations based on input size and supports `.txt` formatted data, making it flexible and efficient for various TSP scales.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NNH)-seeded initial population
* üîÅ Two-point crossover with duplicate prevention
* üß¨ Adaptive mutation rate scaled over generations
* üèÜ Elitism: best individuals retained across generations
* üéØ Roulette Wheel Selection using normalized fitness
* üìè Euclidean distance-based scoring
* ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter tuning based on input size
* üìÑ Readable input/output using text files

## üß∞ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. üì• Input File

Reads `input.txt`, which contains the number of cities and their `(x, y, id)` coordinates.

### 2. üìê Distance Matrix

Builds a full Euclidean distance matrix between all cities.

### 3. üå± Population Initialization

Mixes:

* 60% from Nearest Neighbor tours
* 40% random permutations (diversity boost)

### 4. üìä Fitness Evaluation

Each route is scored based on total distance (lower = better). Fitness scores are normalized.

### 5. üé∞ Selection

Roulette Wheel Selection probabilistically picks parents using normalized fitness scores.

### 6. üîÄ Crossover

Two-point crossover builds children from parents while maintaining valid city sequences.

### 7. üß™ Mutation

Adaptive mutation reverses random route segments with a decreasing mutation rate.

### 8. ü•á Elitism

Top-performing individuals are preserved into the next generation.

### 9. üõë Early Stopping

If the best route doesn't improve for `n` generations, evolution halts early.

### 10. üì§ Output

Saves the best route and its total distance to `output.txt`.

## üìÅ Sample Input (`input.txt`)

```txt
5
0 0 0
1 2 1
3 1 2
6 0 3
5 5 4
```

* Line 1: Number of cities
* Line 2+: Coordinates and index of each city

---

## üìÑ Sample Output (`output.txt`)

```txt
12.345
0 0 0
1 2 1
...
```

* Line 1: Total distance of best route
* Line 2+: Cities in the best visiting sequence

## üß™ How to Run

1. Ensure `input.txt` is in the project folder.
2. Execute the script:

```bash
python tsp_genetic_optimizer.py
```

3. View results in:

```bash
output.txt
```
